## Contents

One of the default data sets in R is the $mtcars$ dataset. This shiny web app will perform Linear Regression on its variables and display results dynamically. 

Web application has 2 parts

* Left Sidebar for Input
* Right Main panel for output

### Left side bar input Panels

You need to pick an Outcome variable and the Predictors. Please use the radio buttons and check boxes.
You can pick several Predictors.
Picking the same Outcome as Predictor has no effect
Changing your picks will update the results dynamically or reactively 

### Right side Output Panels

You will see the results of your picks on the right hand side:

* Plot of fitted values vs Residuals
* Summary of the linear model with coefficients, residuals, statistics, and of course, the formula used.
